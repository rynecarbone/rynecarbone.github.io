				<h3>Chris vs JP</h3>

				<p>When you score less points that STUART in a week, it's time to sound the alarms. PJ Pooper lived up to his legal name when he dropped a turd in his team's punchbowl in week 4, scoring a paltry 91.6 points. Five single-digit performances sunk the SS Pooper in a real bad way, and things are only going to get worse when McMurderer runs Ty into a stacked box this week on 1st and 20 and his broken ribs puncture every single organ in his body.</p>

				<p>As for myself, I'm just enjoying the Drew Brees revenge game victory; when JP doesn't have his holy trinity of Brees, Graham, and Matt Forte, he's doomed. Two out of three is NOT. GOOD. ENOUGH. I'm also enjoying being free of Crowell and Maclin YOU SON OF A BITCH jesus christ my team would be good if I had picked literally anyone fucking else besides Crowell. You know it was a bad pick when you have severe regrets over not picking the guy who just tore his ACL and is out for the season.</p>

				<p>This week I will be playing Adam whose team name is literally bragging about picking up Alex goddamn Smith in free agency because we truly live in the darkest timeline, and JP will have a grand old poop-off against Brian.</p>


				<h3>Jordan vs Adam</h3>

				<p>Bilial Powell's 75 yard touchdown run is perfectly emblematic of Adam's season thus-far. Powell ran through the line and immediately fell down. As Powell obviously should have been ruled down by contact, the Jaguars stopped the play. The refs however, did nothing, allowing Powell to get up and run in for the score. Adam has had the fewest points scored against him all year, blissfully trotting into the endzone while the idiots he's played against stand around like a bunch of goons. Am I certain I'm going to lose against Adam this week? Of course. Hunt will score 20 touchdowns by himself while Odell Beckham gets thrown out of the game for throwing a temper tantrum after a cornerback steals his blanky and Travis Kelce is suspended after biting off a defender's penis.</p>

				<p>Jordan put up the highest points Adam has ever faced this season with a fucking WHOPPING 114.8. Despite HEROIC performances from Jay Ajayi (6.4), Emmanuel Sanders (6.7), Golden Tate (6.1), and Sammy Watkins (2.7), Jordan just couldn't get it done. It must be disheartening for Jordan to put up the most points your opponent has EVER SEEN and still be soundly defeated. Thankfully for Jordan, he plays Stuart this week, and thus the cosmos will allow his players to not be big ole turds again.</p>

				<p>As mentioned, Jordan will win against Stuart this week, and Adam will "hold" me to 4 total points probably.</p>


				<h3>Steve vs Stuart</h3>

				<p>Steve lost the consensus #1 overall pick, drafted Adrian Peterson, and is starting LeGarrette Blount and is 4-0. The universe is dumb and unfair and never makes any sense. To be fair, it was obvious that after Steve's "real" league disbanded he would fall ass-backwards into a total sweep of our pathetic plebian league. Not a single one of us drafted players from just one NFL team; we are a bunch of scrubs. </p>

				<p>We shouldn't put too much stock in his victory this week, however, because it was against Stuart. Somewhere, there is a team of chimpanzees whacking away at a keyboard playing fantasy football and that team of chimpanzees drafted a better roster than what Stuart has managed to put together. The chimpanzees fling poo at each other daily but refuse to touch a print-out of Stuart's roster. They have SOME standards, you guys.</p>

				<p>Steve will probably overcome an injury to Tom Brady with a 70 point game from Delanie Walker or something vs Jeff, and as mentioned Stuart loses against Jordan.</p>


				<h3>Monica vs Brian</h3>

				 <p>Poor, cursed Monica lost to her future brother-in-law despite posting the 3rd highest score of the week. I just kinda feel bad at this point. Brian gets 72 points in three weeks out of Chris Thompson, trades him to Monica the week they play each other, and Thompson lays down 1.7 points. IT WAS AN INSIDE JOB! Look for Thompson to now somehow get injured on his bye week.
				 Brian left 29.1 points from Lamar Miller on his bench and still set the high water mark this week. He's got a good chance of doing it again, too. Winston plays a Patriots team who I can only assume have hired Dom Capers as their part-time defensive coordinator, and Doug Martin is returning from his suspension to average 40 points for the rest of the season because F U C K M O N I C A.</p>

				 <p>Brian plays JP and Monica is out personally injecting steroid shots into each one of Ryne's players as we speak.</p>

				 <h3>Ryne vs Jeff</h3>

				 <p>Two of the league's perennial juggernauts faced off in a mediocre showing that left Ryne coming (heh) out on top. God told me that He gave Russell Wilson superpowers to reward Ryne for his successful PHD defense, because that is how God works. Ryne's triumph was bittersweet, however, as Dalvin "Will Still Outscore Isaiah Crowell" Cook tore his ACL and is out for the rest of the season. Looks like Ryne will have to go back and fire up the Large Hadron Collider and tear our reality asunder again, creating an alternate timeline* where Dalvin Cook didn't tear his ACL, but instead is the superhero The Juggernaut.</p>
				 <p>*This is a literal actual thing that some people literally believe actually happened because of course they do.</p>

				 <p>Jeff faced his own set of injury misfortune with Julio and Gronk getting 
				 banged up and Chris Carson going down for the rest of the season as well. 
				 I guess Carson just couldn't handle Pete Carroll's <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/sports/seahawks/christine-michael-ready-to-lead-the-way-for-seahawks-running-game-sunday-if-needed">big loads</a>.
				 It doesn't matter though, because Belicheck clearly has Chris Hogan on his fantasy team 
				 and no I'm not bitter at all why do you ask DAMN YOU BRANDIN COOOOOOOOOOOKS.</p>

				<p>Ryne plays Monica and Jeff plays Steve.</p>
