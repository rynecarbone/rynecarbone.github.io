        <h1>Week 5</h1>
      </div>

			<div class="col-md-12 bigger">
				
				<p>POWER RANKINGS ARE BACK! THAT'S RIGHT NERDS, I CLEANED UP THE CODE AND FIXED SOME BUGS, ADDED FAVICONS TO THE BROWSER TABS AND MUCH MORE. THE END RESULT LOOKS ALMOST IDENTICAL SO IT'S ALMOST LIKE ALL THAT WORK WAS FOR NOTHING.</p>

				<p>If anybody is interested in generating power rankings, and a website for other leagues you are in, feel free to follow or contribute to my code on <a href="https://github.com/rynecarbone/power_ranker">GitHub</a>. If you run into any issues let me know.</p>

				<h3>The Suspenders (Ryne) vs. Scrubby Squad (Russell)</h3>
				<p>This high-octane, action-packed matchup between two of the leading teams in the "Galileo's Finger" Division proved to live up to the hype. While the final score wasn't flashy, the margin was only 3 points and it came down to Monday Night.</p>
				<p>Despite losing David Johnson in week 1, and Ty Montgomery in the first quarter of the game, The Suspenders put up a respectable showing. Buoyed by a stellar performance by is-he-isn't-he-suspended Elliot, and a solid kicking performance by Gostkowski, The Suspenders were able to stave off a valiant effort by Scrubby Squad. </p>
				<p>Living up to last year's carry-over name, Scrubby Squad was looking good coming into Monday Night, needing only 11 points from Carson. Alas the football gods claimed another injury and ended Scrubby Squad's undefeated streak. With questionable running backs and quarterbacks, Scrubby Squad will need to dig deep going forward, and rely on the red hot hands of Fitzgerald.</p>
				
				<h3>Krispy Kareem (Matt) vs Brees Company (Brad)</h3>
				<p>Coming off a Super Bowl win, Krispy Kareem is putting up monster games followed by duds. Will the boom-bust turn into a full on hang-over, or will Hunt and Nelson continue on their red-hot dominance? Thanks to disappointing turnouts from Gordon and Hill, Krispy Kareem earn's their second loss in four games.</p>
				<p>With a solid double digit performance by everyone except Ebron, Brees Company scores it's second win of the season. They are hoping to improve their record while riding the stellar output of Winston, and hoping for improved play by the WR corp. The loss of Dalvin Cook, however, is sure to put a damper on these plans. Despite not owning Brees anymore, Brees Company is holding steadfast to their name, perhaps to confuse opponents trying to gather stats.</p>

				<h3>The Big Breesy (Zach) vs. The Broken Knee Squad (Frank)</h3>
				<p>The Big Breesy himself is pretty much the only person contributing to Zach's floundering squad. An injury to Gronkowski, underperformance by Brown, and a scortching 1.2 points from Lynch sealed a fourth straight loss for The Big Breesy. The only bright side is perhaps the eventual emergence of Rawls or Lacy as the lead back in Seattle.</p>
				<p>On the complete opposite end of the spectrum, Frank, our current league leader, has defied all expectations, as is tradition. After setting his lineup last week against The Suspenders, Frank once again set his lineup and is on a three game winning streak. With such great talent as the number 2 overall QB Alex Smith, number 1 overall D/ST The Lions, and back-from-the-dead number 3 overall WR Hopkins, The Broken Knee Squad is looking to cause waves this year. With the imminent return of Andrew Luck, TY Hilton will add even more depth to this apparently stacked lineup. </p>

			<h3>For Whom The Bell Tolls (Rex) vs Jet Quenchers (Laura)</h3>
			<p>Despite perfect grammer, For Whom The Bell Tolls is having an embarassingly slow start to the season. Things are looking slightly less bleak, however, as Pryor and Blount put up great stat lines on Rex's bench. The long awaited emergence of Bell will raise the weekly floor, but poor play by Cooks is a concern. This week, disappointing performances by Witten, Watkins, and Cooks, sealed a fourth straight loss. </p>
			<p>Perennial league-struggler, the Jet Quenchers, is off to an exciting start with one of the hottest lineups in the league. With actual blocking for Todd Gurly, it seems he may be back to his freshman-year-self. Solid weekly performances by Powell and Hyde are creating tough matchups for opponents. The only troubling signs are the loss of Eifert, and the injury to Julio. Expect the Jet Quenchers to Jet deep into the playoffs.</p>
			
			<h3>Miami Hurricanes (Felix) vs The Brady Bunch (Meghan)</h3>
			<p>Sporting a team that looks scary on paper, the Miami Hurricanes have stumbled back to .500 thanks to an improved Russell Wilson, and a dominant Travis Kelce. If Lamar Miller can keep up last weeks production, the Hurricanes may climb up the rankings. This week they made easy work of The Brady Bunch, with the only poor performance by Ajayi.  With Smokin' Jay at the helm, it's anyone's guess where the Dolphins are heading, and whether Ajayi will be able to produce. The Hurricanes played Coleman, the backup to The Brady Bunch's Freeman, and outscored Freeman.</p>
			<p>The Brady Bunch is off to a mediocre start, but with Brady on the team, they have a shot to win any week. A 22 point throw-down by the Seattle D/ST wasn't enough to cover for the single digit outings from Cohen, Sanders, Rudolph, and McCaffrey. The Brady Bunch will be hoping for improved play by Murray, otherwise a bleak rest of the season awaits.</p>
